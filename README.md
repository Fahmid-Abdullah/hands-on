# ASL Translator Web App

The ASL Translator is a web application that recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real time and translates them into text, bridging communication gaps for non-ASL users. Developed by a team of seven, the project was showcased at the Toronto Tech Expo (TTE), sparking interest among sponsors for potential startup collaborations.  

## Features  
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Utilizes MediaPipe for efficient hand tracking and gesture data collection.  
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Trained a TensorFlow model to predict over 25 ASL gestures with over 80% accuracy.  
- **Interactive User Experience**: Developed a responsive front-end with React and integrated a Flask-based backend.  
- **Seamless Functionality**: Implemented socket.io to emit predictions in real time, ensuring a smooth user experience.  

## Technical Details  
- **Languages & Tools**: Python, JavaScript, TensorFlow, MediaPipe, React, Flask, Socket.io.  
- **Testing & Optimization**: Conducted rigorous unit testing to fine-tune model performance and enhance accuracy.  

## Collaboration & Communication  
Weekly team meetings facilitated transparent updates and aligned goals, contributing to the project's success and effective teamwork.  

## Acknowledgments  
The ASL Translator was designed with accessibility and inclusivity in mind, demonstrating the potential of technology to bridge language barriers and foster understanding.
